C# Project for Congressional App Challenge 2017

# Description
Back in 2017, I created this application with 2 other friends for the Congressional App Challenge. This application is a C# game made in WPF where you are a student of Tottenville High School and based on your actions throughout the day, your GPA goes up or down.
